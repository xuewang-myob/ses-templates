# ses-templates

These [AWS Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) HTML templates are the default templates used for
notifications sent from the Consent Management service. The HTML template verbiage should also be a reflection of what's
documented in [Confluence](https://adatree.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQBAGw).

## Minifying HTML

HTML templates must be minified (using online tools) before being injected into the service. Be careful when minifying
and ensure the formatter does not remove necessary spaces. These minified templates are currently put into
[adr-platform-deploy](https://github.com/Adatree/adr-platform-deploy/blob/main/service-catalog/products/per-tenant-infra/stack-of-stacks.yaml).

The following identities failed the check in region XXX: xxx@yyy.com
```

* Amazon SES > Configuration: Identities
* Click `Create Identity`
* Follow the prompts to add a verified email address

## Cheatsheet

```bash
#configure tenant
export tenant=xxxxxx

NB: You can easily generate mock `template-data` values by setting a breakpoint in the tests inside the consent
management service eg. `EmailServiceTest`

```bash
#override default email template
aws ses update-template --cli-input-json file://path/to/file.json
```

JSON format can be generated using 
```bash
aws ses update-template --generate-cli-skeleton
```
